Dodgeball dice building game might work as a minimalist card game
three cards are put out. Players bid on them. once all players have had a turn to do their thing ala power grid, a round of dodgeball. repeat x times.
possible event cards, eg. coach guilt, player must start auction on the weakest kid, etc.
maybe numbered cards. can be used as money for bidding or addition to dodgeball round
market like power grid 3 byy three
players start with 1-6 bidding cards in their hand. Player calls out which kid is up to be picked, and his value, the value is where bidding begins. Everyone playing gets to run an auction. Interested Players submit thier bid face down, and all eveal at once. everyone gives their cards one up. Meaning, lowest bid goes to 2nd lowest bid, 2nd lowest goes to 3rd lowest. winner loses card, winner and lowest are now down a bidding card. Ties are preferably handled with cards, but maybe they could also roll dice with governers.(?)
kids have stats: smarts, quickness, power, defense. During a round, you will get points your lowest attribute on your 4 man team. Those points drop down into a second graph.
graph one has cuubes for the stats of your team.
graph 2 is where the lowest drops through and settles for final scoring at the end.
x amount of rounds, and then the scoring is the same, using graph two. maybe add together lowest 2 stats if game needs to be shorter.
Extra cards will also be dealt, things that can fuck other players up, or borrow a player for a game etc.

Players place two cards face down on table, all at once, everyone flips thier first. Lowest is out of the auction. Cards are resolved starting with who's turn it is, clockwise, then the second card. Cards are discarded after purchase. everyone is dealt two cards, then move on.
Everyone plays a card face down, everyone reveals at the same time, resolving effects starting with current player and going clockwise. Whatever the highest value is, is the barrier to the second round. In clockwise order, players can decide if they want to get up to that value, using as many ones as they need, or a single 2. The second bidding round starts, clockwise from current player, players decide if they want to add more. They can play as many ones as they need, or a single two. You cannot match what the current price is, you must either beat it or pass. Whoever has the highest bid at the end get the card. Players are dealt one card, plus another card for those that played in the second bidding round.

beginning of turn, draw power level in cards/tokens

end of turn, discard down to power level

power is minimum 2

coaches - must pay number of ammo to be a part of that auction. When won, they go face up, right on the top of your deck at the end of your end of turn.

- "High Society" style auctions
- Building balanced teams
- Scrambling for limited ball tokens

Whichever of the four values is the lowest total, is the team's "power".

Turn:
	1. Draw according to power
	2. Take actions/attacks
	3. Buy phase
	4. Discard down to power level

Attack - spend ball tokens equal to the highest stat of an enemy cad. Opponant player recieves one of the tokens, and discards the card.

If there are zero ball tokens in the common supply at the start of a player's turn, everyone must return all of their tokens to the supply, then play resumes.
