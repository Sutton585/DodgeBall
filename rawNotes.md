coaches - must pay number of ammo to be a part of that auction. When won, they go face up, right on the top of your deck at the end of your end of turn.
>coaches are now victory cards, and when discarded, go to your "trophy collection" stack, giving ongoing effects similar to players.

##Buying
Either buy for price on upper right plus one token or start an auction at any price. 
>edit 9/24/14: might add this in a future test
>edit 9/24/14: Actually doesn't seem to add much, no need for it.

VP cards have tasks. Owner of card in have can bench card and get a bonus for completing challenge.  Ie. knock out one player. Or for big point cards. Knock out 2 players in one turn. 

Friendly lowest one enemy highest five 
Attack with four to bring it up to five
Enemy response playing 2
Attacker matches 2 in wins giving one of the tokens to the player that just lost the card. If you would've lost at that point he would've still had to get rid of his two as a cost if protecting yourself.  but the attacker that bailed  could grab all of the stuff he put in and keep it
Never mind the attacker loses everything also he just has to give one token to the person he attacked

Dodgeball dice building game might work as a minimalist card game

three cards are put out. Players bid on them. once all players have had a turn to do their thing ala power grid, a round of dodgeball. repeat x times.
possible event cards, eg. coach guilt, player must start auction on the weakest kid, etc.
maybe numbered cards. can be used as money for bidding or addition to dodgeball round
market like power grid 3 byy three
players start with 1-6 bidding cards in their hand. Player calls out which kid is up to be picked, and his value, the value is where bidding begins. Everyone playing gets to run an auction. Interested Players submit thier bid face down, and all eveal at once. everyone gives their cards one up. Meaning, lowest bid goes to 2nd lowest bid, 2nd lowest goes to 3rd lowest. winner loses card, winner and lowest are now down a bidding card. Ties are preferably handled with cards, but maybe they could also roll dice with governers.(?)
kids have stats: smarts, quickness, power, defense. During a round, you will get points your lowest attribute on your 4 man team. Those points drop down into a second graph.
graph one has cuubes for the stats of your team.
graph 2 is where the lowest drops through and settles for final scoring at the end.
x amount of rounds, and then the scoring is the same, using graph two. maybe add together lowest 2 stats if game needs to be shorter.
Extra cards will also be dealt, things that can fuck other players up, or borrow a player for a game etc.

Players place two cards face down on table, all at once, everyone flips thier first. Lowest is out of the auction. Cards are resolved starting with who's turn it is, clockwise, then the second card. Cards are discarded after purchase. everyone is dealt two cards, then move on.
Everyone plays a card face down, everyone reveals at the same time, resolving effects starting with current player and going clockwise. Whatever the highest value is, is the barrier to the second round. In clockwise order, players can decide if they want to get up to that value, using as many ones as they need, or a single 2. The second bidding round starts, clockwise from current player, players decide if they want to add more. They can play as many ones as they need, or a single two. You cannot match what the current price is, you must either beat it or pass. Whoever has the highest bid at the end get the card. Players are dealt one card, plus another card for those that played in the second bidding round.

##Version 3 Notes

###Event Cards
we can target specific players for effects by having a list of the colors, and the player who's color is listed first is who it targets. For example, in a 3 player game there might be a blue, red, and black player. A card may have the following:

- [Yellow, Red, Black, Blue] Player must discard two cards, if this is resolved on their own turn, then they may choose who must discard.

This would mean that the Red Player is the one being targeted, because there is no yellow player, and his color was next. Probably don't even need to list all five colors, you can leave the last one out. Whatever's last on the list isn't going to win anyway, and it's an easy way to simplify the look.


Hail Mary
She hangs out in the back row of the "market", every time she moves, she takes out a character or something. It's har to get to her back there. Once she has reached the end of the back row, she goes on top of the deck, she'll be back out in no time. You immediately have a problem until you can deal with her.
